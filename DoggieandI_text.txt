21752 ""
21752 "I possess a doggie--not a dog, observe, but a doggie.  If he had been a"
21752 "dog I would not have presumed to intrude him on your notice.  A dog is"
21752 "all very well in his way--one of the noblest of animals, I admit, and"
21752 "pre-eminently fitted to be the companion of man, for he has an"
21752 "affectionate nature, which man demands, and a forgiving disposition,"
21752 "which man needs--but a dog, with all his noble qualities, is not to be"
21752 "compared to a doggie."
21752 ""
21752 "My doggie is unquestionably the most charming, and, in every way,"
21752 "delightful doggie that ever was born.  My sister has a baby, about which"
21752 "she raves in somewhat similar terms, but of course that is ridiculous,"
21752 "for her baby differs in no particular from ordinary babies, except,"
21752 "perhaps, in the matter of violent weeping, of which it is fond; whereas"
21752 "my doggie is unique, a perfectly beautiful and singular specimen of--of"
21752 "well, I won't say what, because my friends usually laugh at me when I"
21752 "say it, and I don't like to be laughed at."
21752 ""
21752 "Freely admit that you don't at once perceive the finer qualities, either"
21752 "mental or physical, of my doggie, partly owing to the circumstance that"
21752 "he is shapeless and hairy.  The former quality is not prepossessing,"
21752 "while the latter tends to veil the amiable expression of his countenance"
21752 "and the lustre of his speaking eyes.  But as you come to know him he"
21752 "grows upon you; your feelings are touched, your affections stirred, and"
21752 "your love is finally evoked.  As he resembles a door-mat, or rather a"
21752 "scrap of very ragged door-mat, and has an amiable spirit, I have called"
21752 "him \"Dumps.\"  I should not be surprised if you did not perceive any"
21752 "connection here.  You are not the first who has failed to see it; I"
21752 "never saw it myself."
21752 ""
21752 "When I first met Dumps he was scurrying towards me along a sequestered"
21752 "country lane.  It was in the Dog Days.  Dust lay thick on the road; the"
21752 "creature's legs were remarkably short though active, and his hair being"
21752 "long he swept up the dust in clouds as he ran.  He was yelping, and I"
21752 "observed that one or two stones appeared to be racing with, or after,"
21752 "him.  The voice of an angry man also seemed to chase him, but the owner"
21752 "of the voice was at the moment concealed by a turn in the lane, which"
21752 "was bordered by high stone-walls."
21752 ""
21752 "Hydrophobia, of course, flashed into my mind.  I grasped my stick and"
21752 "drew close to the wall.  The hairy whirlwind, if I may so call it, came"
21752 "wildly on, but instead of passing me, or snapping at my legs as I had"
21752 "expected, it stopped and crawled towards me in a piteous; supplicating"
21752 "manner that at once disarmed me.  If the creature had lain still, I"
21752 "should have been unable to distinguish its head from its tail; but as"
21752 "one end of him whined, and the other wagged, I had no difficulty."
21752 ""
21752 "Stooping down with caution, I patted the end that whined, whereupon the"
21752 "end that wagged became violently demonstrative.  Just then the owner of"
21752 "the voice came round the corner.  He was a big, rough fellow, in ragged"
21752 "garments, and armed with a thick stick, which he seemed about to fling"
21752 "at the little dog, when I checked him with a shout--"
21752 ""
21752 "\"You'd better not, my man, unless you want your own head broken!\""
21752 ""
21752 "You see I am a pretty well-sized man myself, and, as I felt confidence"
21752 "in my strength, my stick, and the goodness of my cause, I was bold."
21752 ""
21752 "\"What d'you mean by ill-treating the little dog?\"  I demanded sternly,"
21752 "as I stepped up to the man."
21752 ""
21752 "\"A cove may do as he likes with his own, mayn't he?\" answered the man,"
21752 "with a sulky scowl."
21752 ""
21752 "\"A `cove' may do nothing of the sort,\" said I indignantly, for cruelty"
21752 "to dumb animals always has the effect of inclining me to fight, though I"
21752 "am naturally of a peaceable disposition.  \"There is an Act of"
21752 "Parliament,\" I continued, \"which goes by the honoured name of Martin,"
21752 "and if you venture to infringe that Act I'll have you taken up and"
21752 "prosecuted.\""
21752 ""
21752 "While I was speaking I observed a peculiar leer on the man's face, which"
21752 "I could not account for.  He appeared, however, to have been affected by"
21752 "my threats, for he ceased to scowl, and assumed a deferential air as he"
21752 "replied, \"Vell, sir, it do seem raither 'ard that a cove should be"
21752 "blowed up for kindness.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Kindness!\"  I exclaimed, in surprise."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Ay, kindness, sir.  That there hanimal loves me, it do, like a brother,"
21752 "an the love is mootooal.  Ve've lived together now--off an' on--for the"
21752 "matter o' six months.  Vell, I gits employment in a factory about"
21752 "fifteen miles from here, in which no dogs is allowed.  In coorse, I"
21752 "can't throw up my sitivation, sir, can I?  Neither can my doggie give up"
21752 "his master wot he's so fond of, so I'm obleeged to leave 'im in charge"
21752 "of a friend, with stric' orders to keep 'im locked up till I'm fairly"
21752 "gone.  Vell, off I goes, but he manages to escape, an' runs arter me."
21752 "Now, wot can a feller do but drive 'im 'ome with sticks an' stones,"
21752 "though it do go to my 'eart to do it? but if he goes to the factory he's"
21752 "sure to be shot, or scragged, or drownded, or somethink; so you see,"
21752 "sir, it's out o' pure kindness I'm a peltin' of 'im.\""
21752 ""
21752 "Confess that I felt somewhat doubtful of the truth of this story; but,"
21752 "in order to prevent any expression of my face betraying me, I stooped"
21752 "and patted the dog while the man spoke.  It received my attentions with"
21752 "evident delight.  A thought suddenly flashed on me:--"
21752 ""
21752 "\"Will you sell your little dog?\"  I asked."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Vy, sir,\" he replied, with some hesitation, \"I don't quite like to do"
21752 "that.  He's such a pure breed, and--and he's so fond o' me.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"But have you not told me that you are obliged to part with him?\""
21752 ""
21752 "I thought the man looked puzzled for a moment, but only for a moment."
21752 "Turning to me with a bland smile, he said, \"Ah, sir I that's just where"
21752 "it is.  I am obleeged to part with him, but I ain't obleeged to sell"
21752 "him.  If I on'y part with 'im, my friend keeps 'im for me, and we may"
21752 "meet again, but if I sell 'im, he's gone for ever!  Don't you see?"
21752 "Hows'ever, if you wants 'im wery bad, I'll do it on one consideration.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"And that is?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"That you'll be good to 'im.\""
21752 ""
21752 "I began to think I had misjudged the man.  \"What's his name?\"  I asked."
21752 ""
21752 "Again for one moment there was that strange, puzzled look in the man's"
21752 "face, but it passed, and he turned with another of his bland smiles."
21752 ""
21752 "\"His name, sir?  Ah, his name?  He ain't got no name, sir!\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"No name!\"  I exclaimed, in surprise."
21752 ""
21752 "\"No, sir; I object to givin' dogs names on principle.  It's too much"
21752 "like treatin' them as if they wos Christians; and, you know, they"
21752 "couldn't be Christians if they wanted to ever so much.  Besides, wotever"
21752 "name you gives 'em, there must be so many other dogs with the same name,"
21752 "that you stand a chance o' the wrong dog comin' to 'e ven you calls.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"That's a strange reason.  How then do you call him to you?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Vy, w'en I wants 'im I shouts `Hi,' or `Hallo,' or I vistles.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Indeed,\" said I, somewhat amused by the humour of the fellow; \"and what"
21752 "do you ask for him?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Fi' pun ten, an' he's dirt cheap at that,\" was the quick reply."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Come, come, my man, you know the dog is not worth that.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Not worth it, sir!\" he replied, with an injured look; \"I tell you he's"
21752 "cheap at that.  Look at his breedin', and then think of his affectionate"
21752 "natur'.  Is the affections to count for nuffin'?\""
21752 ""
21752 "Admitted that the affections were worth money, though it was generally"
21752 "understood that they could not be purchased, but still objected to the"
21752 "price, until the man said in a confidential tone--"
21752 ""
21752 "\"Vell, come, sir, since you do express such a deal o' love for 'im, and"
21752 "promise to be so good to 'im, I'll make a sacrifice and let you 'ave 'im"
21752 "for three pun ten--come!\""
21752 ""
21752 "Gave in, and walked off, with my purchase leaping joyfully at my heels."
21752 ""
21752 "The man chuckled a good deal after receiving the money, but I took no"
21752 "notice of that at the time, though I thought a good deal about it"
21752 "afterwards."
21752 ""
21752 "Ah! little did I think, as Dumps and I walked home that day, of the"
21752 "depth of the attachment that was to spring up between us, the varied"
21752 "experiences of life we were destined to have together, and the important"
21752 "influence he was to exercise on my career."
21752 ""
21752 "Forgot to mention that my name is Mellon--John Mellon.  Dumps knows my"
21752 "name as well as he knows his own."
21752 ""
21752 "On reaching home, Dumps displayed an evidence of good breeding, which"
21752 "convinced me that he could not have spent all his puppyhood in company"
21752 "with the man from whom I had bought him.  He wiped his feet on the"
21752 "door-mat with great vigour before entering my house, and also refused to"
21752 "pass in until I led the way."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Now, Dumps,\" said I, seating myself on the sofa in my solitary room (I"
21752 "was a bachelor at the time--a medical student, just on the point of"
21752 "completing my course), \"come here, and let us have a talk.\""
21752 ""
21752 "To my surprise, the doggie came promptly forward, sat down on his"
21752 "hind-legs, and looked up into my face.  I was touched by this display of"
21752 "ready confidence.  A confiding nature has always been to me powerfully"
21752 "attractive, whether in child, cat, or dog.  I brushed the shaggy hair"
21752 "from his face in order to see his eyes.  They were moist, and intensely"
21752 "black.  So was the point of his nose."
21752 ""
21752 "\"You seem to be an affectionate doggie, Dumps.\""
21752 ""
21752 "A portion of hair--scarce worthy the name of tail--wagged as I spoke,"
21752 "and he attempted to lick my fingers, but I prevented this by patting his"
21752 "head.  I have an unconquerable aversion to licking.  Perhaps having"
21752 "received more than an average allowance, in another sense, at school,"
21752 "may account for my dislike to it--even from a dog!"
21752 ""
21752 "\"Now, Dumps,\" I continued, \"you and I are to be good friends.  I've"
21752 "bought you--for a pretty large sum too, let me tell you--from a man who,"
21752 "I am quite sure, treated you ill, and I intend to show you what good"
21752 "treatment is; but there are two things I mean to insist on, and it is"
21752 "well that we should understand each other at the outset of our united"
21752 "career.  You must never bark at my friends--not even at my enemies--when"
21752 "they come to see me, and you must not beg at meals.  D'you understand?\""
21752 ""
21752 "The way in which that shaggy creature cocked its ears and turned its"
21752 "head from side to side slowly, and gazed with its lustrous eyes while I"
21752 "was speaking, went far to convince me it really did understand what I"
21752 "said.  Of course it only wagged its rear tuft of hair in reply, and"
21752 "whimpered slightly."
21752 ""
21752 "Refer to its rear tuft advisedly, because, at a short distance, my"
21752 "doggie, when in repose, resembled an elongated and shapeless mass; but,"
21752 "when roused by a call or otherwise, three tufts of hair instantly sprang"
21752 "up--two at one end, and one at the other end--indicating his ears and"
21752 "tail.  It was only by these signs that I could ascertain at any time his"
21752 "exact position."
21752 ""
21752 "I was about to continue my remarks to Dumps when the door opened and my"
21752 "landlady appeared bearing the dinner tray."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh!  I beg parding, sir,\" she said, drawing back, \"I didn't 'ear your"
21752 "voice, sir, till the door was open, an' I thought you was alone, but I"
21752 "can come back a--\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Come in, Mrs Miff.  There is nobody here but my little dog--one that I"
21752 "have just bought, a rather shaggy terrier--what do you think of him?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Do 'e bite, sir?\" inquired Mrs Miff, in some anxiety, as she passed"
21752 "round the table at a respectful distance from Dumps."
21752 ""
21752 "\"I think not.  He seems an amiable creature,\" said I, patting his head."
21752 "\"Do you ever bite, Dumps?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Well, sir, I never feel quite easy,\" rejoined Mrs Miff in a doubtful"
21752 "tone, as she laid my cloth, with, as it were, one eye ever on the alert:"
21752 "\"you never knows w'en these 'airy creatures is goin' to fly at you.  If"
21752 "you could see their heyes you might 'ave a guess what they was a"
21752 "thinkin' of; an' then it is so orkard not knowin' w'ich end of the 'airy"
21752 "bundle is the bitin' end, you can't help bein' nervish a little.\""
21752 ""
21752 "Having finished laying the cloth, Mrs Miff backed out of the room after"
21752 "the manner of attendants on royalty, overturning two chairs with her"
21752 "skirts as she went, and showing her full front to the enemy.  But the"
21752 "enemy gave no sign, good or bad.  All the tufts were down flat, and he"
21752 "stood motionless while Mrs Miff retreated."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Dumps, what do you think of Mrs Miff?\""
21752 ""
21752 "The doggie ran to me at once, and we engaged in a little further"
21752 "conversation until my landlady returned with the viands.  To my surprise"
21752 "Dumps at once walked sedately to the hearth-rug, and lay down thereon,"
21752 "with his chin on his paws--at least I judged so from the attitude, for I"
21752 "could see neither chin nor paws."
21752 ""
21752 "This act I regarded as another evidence of good breeding.  He was not a"
21752 "beggar, and, therefore, could not have spent his childhood with the man"
21752 "from whom I had bought him."
21752 ""
21752 "\"I wish you could speak, Dumps,\" said I, laying down my knife and fork,"
21752 "when about half finished, and looking towards the hearth-rug."
21752 ""
21752 "One end of him rose a little, the other end wagged gently, but as I made"
21752 "no further remark, both ends subsided."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Now, Dumps,\" said I, finishing my meal with a draught of water, which"
21752 "is my favourite beverage, \"you must not suppose that you have got a"
21752 "greedy master; though I don't allow begging.  There, sir, is your"
21752 "corner, where you shall always have the remnants of my dinner--come.\""
21752 ""
21752 "The dog did not move until I said, \"come.\"  Then, with a quick rush he"
21752 "made for the plate, and very soon cleared it."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Well, you have been well trained,\" said I, regarding him with interest;"
21752 "\"such conduct is neither the result of instinct nor accident, and sure"
21752 "am I, the more I think of it, that the sulky fellow who sold you to me"
21752 "was not your tutor; but, as you can't speak, I shall never find out your"
21752 "history, so, Dumps, I'll dismiss the subject.\""
21752 ""
21752 "Saying this, I sat down to the newspaper with which I invariably solaced"
21752 "myself for half an hour after dinner, before going out on my afternoon"
21752 "rounds."
21752 ""
21752 "This was the manner in which my doggie and I began our acquaintance, and"
21752 "I have been thus particular in recounting the details, because they bear"
21752 "in a special manner on some of the most important events of my life."
21752 ""
21752 "Being, as already mentioned, a medical student, and having almost"
21752 "completed my course of study, I had undertaken to visit in one of the"
21752 "poorest districts in London--in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel; partly"
21752 "for the purpose of gaining experience in my profession, and partly for"
21752 "the sake of carrying the Word of Life--the knowledge of the Saviour--"
21752 "into some of the many homes where moral as well as physical disease is"
21752 "rife."
21752 ""
21752 "Leanings and inclinations are inherited not less than bodily"
21752 "peculiarities.  My father had a particular tenderness for poor old women"
21752 "of the lowest class.  So have I.  When I see a bowed, aged, wrinkled,"
21752 "white-haired, feeble woman in rags and dirt, a gush of tender pity"
21752 "almost irresistibly inclines me to go and pat her head, sit down beside"
21752 "her, comfort her, and give her money.  It matters not what her"
21752 "antecedents may have been.  Worthy or unworthy, there she stands now,"
21752 "with age, helplessness, and a hopeless temporal future, pleading more"
21752 "eloquently in her behalf than could the tongue of man or angel.  True,"
21752 "the same plea is equally applicable to poor old men, but, reader, I"
21752 "write not at present of principles so much as of feelings.  My weakness"
21752 "is old women!"
21752 ""
21752 "Accordingly, on my professional visiting list--I had at that time a"
21752 "considerable number of these.  One of them, who was uncommonly small,"
21752 "unusually miserable, and pathetically feeble, lay heavy on my spirit"
21752 "just then.  She had a remarkably bad cold at the time, which betrayed"
21752 "itself chiefly in a frequent, but feeble, sneeze."
21752 ""
21752 "As I rose to go out, and looked at my doggie--who was, or seemed to be,"
21752 "asleep on the rug--a sudden thought occurred to me."
21752 ""
21752 "\"That poor old creature,\" I muttered, \"is very lonely in her garret; a"
21752 "little dog might comfort her.  Perhaps--but no.  Dumps, you are too"
21752 "lively for her, too bouncing.  She would require something feeble and"
21752 "affectionate, like herself.  Come, I'll think of that.  So, my doggie,"
21752 "you shall keep watch here until I return.\""

21752 "The day had become very sultry by the time I went out to visit my"
21752 "patients.  The sky was overcast with dark thunderous clouds, and, as"
21752 "there seemed every chance of a heavy shower, I returned to my lodgings"
21752 "for an umbrella."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh, Mr Mellon!\" exclaimed my landlady, as I entered the lobby, \"was"
21752 "there ever a greater blessin'--oh!--\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Why, what's the matter, Mrs Miff?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh, sir! that 'orrid little dog as you brought 'as gone mad!\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Is that the blessing you refer to, Mrs Miff?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"No, sir; but your comin' back is, for the creetur 'as bin rampagin'"
21752 "round the room, an yellin' like a thing possessed by demons.  I'm so"
21752 "glad you've come!\""
21752 ""
21752 "Feeling sure that the little dog, unaccustomed, perhaps, to be left"
21752 "alone in a strange place, was merely anxious to be free, I at once went"
21752 "to my room-door and opened it.  Dumps bounced out, and danced joyfully"
21752 "round me.  Mrs Miff fled in deadly silence to her own bedroom, where"
21752 "she locked and bolted herself in."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Dumps,\" said I, with a laugh, \"I shall have to take you with me at the"
21752 "risk of losing you.  Perhaps the memory of the feed I've given you, and"
21752 "the hope of another, may keep you by me.  Come, we shall see.\""
21752 ""
21752 "My doggie behaved much better than I had anticipated.  He did indeed"
21752 "stop at several butchers' shops during our walk, and looked inquiringly"
21752 "in.  He also evinced a desire to enter into conversation with one or two"
21752 "other sociable dogs, but the briefest chirp or whistle brought him at"
21752 "once obediently to my heel, just as if he had known and obeyed me all"
21752 "his life."
21752 ""
21752 "When we reached the poorer parts of the city, I observed that the"
21752 "free-and-easy swagger, and the jaunty hopping of each hind-leg"
21752 "alternately, gave place to a sedate walk and a wary turn of the head,"
21752 "which suggested keen suspicious glances of the unseen eyes."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Ah!\" thought I, \"evidently he has suffered hardships and bad treatment"
21752 "in places like this.\""
21752 ""
21752 "I stooped and patted his head.  He drew closer to me, as if seeking"
21752 "protection."
21752 ""
21752 "Just then a low grumbling of thunder was heard, and soon after the rain"
21752 "came down so heavily that, the umbrella forming an insufficient"
21752 "protection, Dumps and I sought shelter in the mouth of an alley.  The"
21752 "plump was short-lived, and the little knots of people who had sought"
21752 "shelter along with us melted quickly away."

21752 "_good_ one myself, I do claim to be a poor follower of Jesus.  Yet here"
21752 "am I--\""
21752 ""
21752 "She paused."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Well, granny,\" said I, \"are you forsaken?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Nay, John, God forbid that I should say so; but am I not a beggar?  Ah"
21752 "pride, pride, you are hard to kill!\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"_Are_ you a beggar?\"  I asked in a tone of surprise.  \"When did you beg"
21752 "last, granny?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Is not a recipient of charity a beggar?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"No,\" I replied stoutly, \"he is not.  A solicitor of charity is a"
21752 "beggar, but a recipient thereof is not.  In your case it was I who was"
21752 "the beggar.  Do you not remember when I found you first, without a crust"
21752 "in the house, how I had to beg and entreat you to allow me to put your"
21752 "name on this charity, and how you persistently refused, until at last I"
21752 "did it without your consent; and how, eventually, you gave in only when"
21752 "I charged you with pride?  You are not forsaken, granny, and you are not"
21752 "a beggar.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Brayvo, doctor! you have 'er there!\" came in a soft whisper from the"
21752 "door."
21752 ""
21752 "For a moment I felt tempted to turn the boy out, as I had turned out the"
21752 "dog; but, seeing that my old woman had not overheard the remark, I took"
21752 "no notice of it."
21752 ""
21752 "\"You have put the matter in a new light John,\" said Mrs Willis slowly,"
21752 "as her eyes once more sought the spout.  \"You often put things in new"
21752 "lights, and there does seem some truth in what you say.  It did hurt my"
21752 "pride at first, but I'm gettin' used to it now.  Besides,\" continued the"
21752 "old lady, with a deep sigh, \"that trouble and everything else is"
21752 "swallowed up in the great sorrow of my life.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Ah! you refer to your granddaughter, I suppose,\" said I in a tone of"
21752 "profound sympathy.  \"You have never told me about her, dear granny.  If"
21752 "it is not too painful a subject to speak of, I should like to hear about"
21752 "her.  When did she die?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Die!\" exclaimed Mrs Willis with a burst of energy that surprised"
21752 "me--\"she did not die!  She left me many, many months ago, it seems like"
21752 "years now.  My Edie went out one afternoon to walk, like a beautiful"
21752 "sunbeam as she always was, and--and--she never came back!\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Never came back!\"  I echoed, in surprise."
21752 ""
21752 "\"No--never.  I was not able to walk then, any more than now, else I"
21752 "would have ranged London all round, day and night, for my darling.  As"
21752 "it was, a kind city missionary made inquiries at all the police-offices,"
21752 "and everywhere else he could think of, but no clew could be gained as to"
21752 "what had become of her.  At last he got wearied out and gave it up.  No"
21752 "wonder; he had never seen Edie, and could not love her as I did.  Once"
21752 "he thought he had discovered her.  The body of a poor girl had been"
21752 "found in the river, which he thought answered to her description.  I"
21752 "thought so too when he told me what she was like, and at once concluded"
21752 "she had tumbled in by accident and been drowned--for, you see, my Edie"
21752 "was good and pure and true.  She could not have committed suicide unless"
21752 "her mind had become deranged, and there was nothing that I knew of to"
21752 "bring about that.  They got me with much trouble into a cab, and drove"
21752 "me to the place.  Ah! the poor thing--she was fair and sweet to look"
21752 "upon, with her curling brown hair and a smile still on the parted lips,"
21752 "as if she had welcomed Death; but she was not my Edie.  For months and"
21752 "months after that I waited and waited, feeling sure that she would come."
21752 "Then I was forced to leave my lodging.  The landlord wanted it himself."
21752 "I begged that he would let me remain, but he would not.  He was a"
21752 "hard-hearted, dissipated man.  I took another lodging, but it was a long"
21752 "way off, and left my name and new address at the old one.  My heart sank"
21752 "after that, and--and I've no hope now--no hope.  My darling must have"
21752 "met with an accident in this terrible city.  She must have been killed,"
21752 "and will never come back to me.\""
21752 ""
21752 "The poor creature uttered a low wail, and put a handkerchief to her old"
21752 "eyes."
21752 ""
21752 "\"But, bless the Lord!\" she added in a more cheerful tone, \"I will go to"
21752 "her--soon.\""
21752 ""
21752 "For some minutes I knew not what to say in reply, by way of comforting"
21752 "my poor old friend.  The case seemed indeed so hopeless.  I could only"
21752 "press her hand.  But my nature is naturally buoyant, and ready to hope"
21752 "against hope, even when distress assails myself."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Do not say there is no hope, granny,\" said I at last, making an effort"
21752 "to be cheerful.  \"You know that with God all things are possible.  It"
21752 "may be that this missionary did not go the right way to work in his"
21752 "search, however good his intentions might have been.  I confess I cannot"
21752 "imagine how it is possible that any girl should disappear in this way,"
21752 "unless she had deliberately gone off with some one.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"No, John, my Edie would not have left me thus of her own free will,\""
21752 "said the old woman, with a look of assurance which showed that her mind"
21752 "was immovably fixed as to that point."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Well, then,\" I continued, \"loving you as you say she did, and being"
21752 "incapable of leaving you deliberately and without a word of explanation,"
21752 "it follows that--that--\""
21752 ""
21752 "I stopped, for at this point no plausible reason for the girl's"
21752 "disappearance suggested itself."
21752 ""
21752 "\"It follows that she must have been killed,\" said the old woman in a low"
21752 "broken tone."
21752 ""
21752 "\"No, granny, I will not admit that.--Come, cheer up; I will do my best"
21752 "to make inquiries about her, and as I have had considerable experience"
21752 "in making investigations among the poor of London, perhaps I may fall on"
21752 "some clew.  She would be sure to have made inquiries, would she not, at"
21752 "your old lodging, if she had felt disposed to return?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Felt disposed!\" repeated Mrs Willis, with a strange laugh.  \"If she"
21752 "_could_ return, you mean.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Well--if she could,\" said I."
21752 ""
21752 "\"No doubt she would; but soon after I left my old lodging the landlord"
21752 "fled the country, and other people came to the house, who were troubled"
21752 "by my sending so often to inquire.  Then my money was all expended, and"
21752 "I had to quit my second lodging, and came here, which is far, far from"
21752 "the old lodging, and now I have no one to send.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Have you any friends in London?\"  I asked."
21752 ""
21752 "\"No.  We had come from York to try to find teaching for my darling, for"
21752 "we could get none in our native town, and we had not been long enough in"
21752 "London to make new friends when--when--she went away.  My dear Ann and"
21752 "Willie, her mother and father, died last year, and now we have no near"
21752 "relations in the world.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Shall I read to you, granny?\" said I, feeling that no words of mine"
21752 "could do much to comfort one in so sad a case."
21752 ""
21752 "She readily assented.  I was in the habit of reading and praying with"
21752 "her during these visits.  I turned, without any definite intention of"
21752 "doing so, to the words, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy"
21752 "laden, and I will give you rest.\"  I cannot tell why, but I paused here"
21752 "instead of reading on, or commenting on the words."
21752 ""
21752 "The old woman looked earnestly at me."
21752 ""
21752 "\"These words,\" she said, \"have been in my mind all yesterday and the day"
21752 "before.  I have been greatly comforted by them, because `He is faithful"
21752 "who has promised.'  Pray over them, John; don't read any more.\""
21752 ""
21752 "I knelt by the poor woman's chair; she could not kneel with me in body,"
21752 "though she did in spirit, I doubt not.  I had quite forgotten Slidder,"
21752 "but, on rising, observed that he had followed my example and gone down"
21752 "on his knees."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Were you praying with us, Slidder?\"  I asked, after we left Mrs"
21752 "Willis, and were walking up the alley, followed by Dumps."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Dun know, sir; I've never heard nor seen nuffin' o' this sort before."
21752 "In coorse I've heard the missionaries sometimes, a-hollerin' about the"

21752 "that's a rum go about that gal Edie--ain't it?  I've quite took a fancy"

21752 "drownded?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"I scarce know what to think.  Her disappearance so suddenly does seem"
21752 "very strange.  I fear, I fear much that--however, it's of no use"
21752 "guessing.  I shall at once set about making inquiries.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Ha! so shall I,\" said the little waif, with a look of determination on"
21752 "his small face that amused me greatly, \"for she's a good gal is Edie--if"
21752 "she ain't drownded.\""

21752 "\"Why, boy, how can you know whether the girl is good or bad?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"How can I know?\" he echoed, with a glance of almost superhuman wisdom."
21752 "\"In coorse I know by the powers of obserwation.  That old gal, Mrs"
21752 "Willis, is a good old thing--as good as gold.  Vell, a good mother is"
21752 "always cocksure to 'ave a good darter--specially ven she's a only"
21752 "darter--so the mother o' Edie bein' good, Edie herself _must_ be good,"
21752 "don't you see?  Anythink as belonged to Mrs Willis can't help bein'"
21752 "good.  I'm glad you took me to see her, doctor, for I've made up my mind"

21752 "On questioning him further I found that this ragged and homeless little"

21752 "towards her by her soft, gentle nature--so different from what he had"
21752 "hitherto met with in his wanderings,--and that he was resolved to offer"
21752 "her his gratuitous services as a message-boy and general servant,"
21752 "without requiring either food or lodging in return."

21752 "\"But Mrs Willis may object to such a dirty ragged fellow coming about"

21752 "pity, \"no soap?\""

21752 "\"True,\" I replied, with a laugh, \"but you'd require needles and thread"

21752 "We had both taken two or three steps in opposite directions, when, as if"
21752 "under the same impulse, we looked back at each other, and in so doing"
21752 "became aware of the fact that Dumps stood between us on the pavement in"
21752 "a state of extreme indecision or mental confusion."

21752 "One morning, a considerable time after the events narrated in the last"
21752 "chapter, I sat on the sofa waiting for breakfast, and engaged in an"
21752 "interesting conversation with Dumps.  The only difference in our mode of"
21752 "communication was that Dumps talked with his eyes, I with my tongue."
21752 ""
21752 "From what I have already said about my doggie, it will be understood"
21752 "that his eyes--which were brown and speaking eyes--lay behind such a"
21752 "forest of hair that it was only by clearing the dense masses away that I"
21752 "could obtain a full view of his liquid orbs.  I am not sure that his"
21752 "ears were much less expressive than his eyes.  Their variety of motion,"
21752 "coupled with their rate of action, served greatly to develop the full"
21752 "meaning of what his eyes said."

21752 "\"Indeed it ain't, mum,\" tubed John in reply.  \"It's on'y that little dog"

21752 "the dark.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Very well, mum,\" said John, obedient but savage."
21752 ""
21752 "He arose, upset the poker and pistol with a hideous clatter, which was"
21752 "luckily too remote to smite horror into the heart of Mrs McTougall, and"
21752 "groped his way into the servants' hall.  Lighting a paraffin lamp, he"
21752 "went to the scullery, using very unfair and harsh language towards my"
21752 "innocent dog."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Pompey, you brute!\"--the footman had already learned his name--\"hold"
21752 "your noise.  There!\""
21752 ""
21752 "He set the lamp on the head of the beer cask and returned to bed."
21752 ""
21752 "It is believed that poor perplexed Dumps viewed the midnight apparition"
21752 "with silent surprise, and wagged his tail, being friendly; then gazed at"
21752 "the lamp after the apparition had retired, until obliged to give the"
21752 "subject up, like a difficult conundrum, and finally went to sleep--"
21752 "perchance to dream--of dogs, or me!"
21752 ""
21752 "It was while Dumps was thus engaged that Brassey and the Slogger walked"
21752 "up to the front of the house and surveyed it in silence for a few"
21752 "minutes.  They also took particular observations of both ends of the"
21752 "street."
21752 ""
21752 "\"All serene,\" said Brassey; \"now, you go round to the back and use your"
21752 "key quietly.  Give 'im the bit o' meat quick.  He won't give tongue"
21752 "arter 'e smells it, and one or two barks won't alarm the 'ouse.  So, get"
21752 "along, Slogger.  W'en you've got him snug, with a rope round 'is neck"
21752 "an' 'is head in the flannel bag, just caterwaul an' I'll come round."
21752 "Bless the cats! they're a great help to gentlemen in our procession.\""
21752 ""
21752 "Thus admonished, the Slogger chuckled and melted into the darkness,"
21752 "while Brassey mingled himself with the shadow of a pillar."
21752 ""
21752 "The key--lost by the care-taker and found by the burglar--fitted into"
21752 "the empty lock even more perfectly than that which Mrs McTougall had"
21752 "conveyed to her mantelpiece some hours before.  It was well oiled too,"
21752 "and went round in the wards of the lock without giving a chirp, so that"
21752 "the bolt flew back with one solitary shot.  The report, however, was"
21752 "loud.  It caused Dumps to return from Dogland and raise his head with a"
21752 "decided growl."
21752 ""
21752 "Nobody heard the growl except the Slogger, who stood perfectly still for"
21752 "nearly a minute, with his hand on the door-handle.  Then he opened the"
21752 "door slowly and softly--so slowly and softly that an alarm-bell attached"
21752 "to it did not ring."
21752 ""
21752 "A sharp bow! wow! wow! however, greeted him as he entered, but he was"
21752 "prompt.  A small piece of meat fell directly under the nose of Dumps, as"
21752 "he stood bristling in front of his box; and, let me add, when Dumps"
21752 "bristled it was a sight to behold!"
21752 ""
21752 "\"Good dog--good do-o-og,\" said the Slogger, in his softest and most"
21752 "insinuating tone."
21752 ""
21752 "Dumps reduced his bark to a growl."
21752 ""
21752 "The footman heard both bark and growl, but, attributing them to the"
21752 "influence of cats, turned on his other side and listened--not for"
21752 "burglars, innocent man, but for the tube."
21752 ""
21752 "It was silent!  Evidently \"tired nature\" was, in Mrs McTougall's case,"
21752 "lulled by the \"sweet restorer.\"  Forthwith John betook himself again to"
21752 "the land of Nod."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Have another bit?\" said the Slogger in quite a friendly way, after the"
21752 "first bit had been devoured."
21752 ""
21752 "My too trusting favourite wagged his tail and innocently accepted the"
21752 "bribe."
21752 ""
21752 "It was good cat's meat.  Dumps liked it.  The enormous supper with which"
21752 "he had lain down was by that time nearly assimilated, and appetite had"
21752 "begun to revive.  Going down on his knee the young burglar held out a"
21752 "third morsel of temptation in his hand.  Dumps meekly advanced and took"
21752 "the meat.  It was a sad illustration of the ease with which even a dog"
21752 "descends from bad to worse."
21752 ""
21752 "While he was engaged with it the Slogger gently patted his head."
21752 ""
21752 "Suddenly Dumps found his muzzle grasped and held tight in a powerful"
21752 "hand.  He tried to bark and yell, but could produce nothing better than"
21752 "a scarcely audible whine.  His sides were at the same instant grasped by"
21752 "a pair of powerful knees, while a rope was twisted round his neck, and"
21752 "the process of strangulation began."
21752 ""
21752 "But strangulation was not the Slogger's intention.  He had been"
21752 "carefully warned not to kill."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Mind, now, you don't screw 'im up too tight,\" Brassey had said, when"
21752 "giving the boy his instructions before starting.  \"Dogs is vurth munny."
21752 "Just 'old 'im tight and quiet till you get the flannel bag on 'is head,"
21752 "and then stand by till I've sacked the swag.\""
21752 ""
21752 "Accordingly, having effected the bagging of the dog's head, the young"
21752 "burglar went to the door, holding Dumps tight in his arms, and uttered a"
21752 "pretty loud and life-like caterwaul.  Brassey heard it, emerged from the"
21752 "shade of his pillar, and was soon beside his comrade."
21752 ""
21752 "When Dumps smelt and heard the new-comer, he redoubled his efforts to"
21752 "free his head and yell, but the Slogger was too much for him."
21752 ""
21752 "Few words were wasted on this occasion.  The couple understood their"
21752 "work.  Brassey took up the lamp."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Wery considerate of 'em to 'ave a light all ready for us,\" he muttered,"
21752 "as he lowered the flame a little, and glided into the kitchen, leaving"
21752 "the Slogger on guard in the scullery.  Here he found a variety of gins"
21752 "and snares carefully placed for him--and such as he--by strict orders of"
21752 "Mrs McTougall.  Besides a swing-bell on the window shutter--similar to"
21752 "that which had done so little service on the scullery door--there was a"
21752 "coal-scuttle with the kitchen tongs balanced against it and a tin"
21752 "slop-pail in company with the kitchen shovel, and a watering-pan,"
21752 "which--the poker being already engaged to John--was balanced on its own"
21752 "rose and handle, all ready to fail with a touch.  These outworks being"
21752 "echelloned along the floor rendered it impossible for an intruder to"
21752 "cross the kitchen in the dark without overturning one or more of them."
21752 "Thanks to the lamp, Brassey steered his way carefully and with a grim"
21752 "smile."
21752 ""
21752 "At John Waters's door he paused and listened.  John's nose revealed his"
21752 "condition."
21752 ""
21752 "Gliding up the stairs on shoeless feet the burglar entered the"
21752 "dining-room, picked the locks of the sideboard with marvellous celerity,"
21752 "unfolded a canvas bag, and placed therein whatever valuables he could"
21752 "lay hands on.  Proceeding next to the drawing-room floor, he began to"
21752 "examine and appropriate the articles of _vertu_ that appeared to him"
21752 "most valuable."
21752 ""
21752 "Not being a perfect judge of such matters, Mr Brassey was naturally"
21752 "puzzled with some of them.  One in particular caused him to regard it"
21752 "with frowning attention for nearly a minute before he came to the"
21752 "conclusion that it was \"vurth munny.\"  He placed the lamp on the small"
21752 "table near the window, from which he had lifted the ornament in"
21752 "question, and sat down on a crimson chair with gilded legs to examine it"
21752 "more critically."
21752 ""
21752 "Meanwhile the Slogger, left in the dark with the still fitfully"
21752 "struggling Dumps, employed his leisure in running over some of the"
21752 "salient events of his past career, and in trying to ascertain, by the"
21752 "very faint light that came from a distant street-lamp, what was the"
21752 "nature of his immediate surroundings.  His nose told him that the cask"
21752 "at his elbow was beer.  His exploring right hand told him that the tap"
21752 "was in it.  His native intelligence suggested a tumbler on the head of"
21752 "the cask, and the exploring hand proved the idea to be correct."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Brassey was wery 'ard on me to-night,\" he thought.  \"I'd like to have a"
21752 "swig.\""
21752 ""
21752 "But Dumps was sadly in the way.  To remove his left hand even for an"
21752 "instant from the dog's muzzle was not to be thought of.  In this dilemma"
21752 "he resolved to tie up the said muzzle, and the legs also, even at the"
21752 "risk of causing death.  It would not take more than a minute to draw a"
21752 "tumblerful, and any dog worth a straw could hold his wind for a minute."
21752 "He would try.  He did try, and was yet in the act of drawing the beer"
21752 "when my doggie burst his bonds by a frantic effort to be free.  Probably"
21752 "the hairy nature of his little body had rendered a firm bond impossible."
21752 "At all events, he suddenly found his legs loose.  Another effort, more"
21752 "frantic than before, set free the muzzle, and then there arose on the"
21752 "still night air a yell so shrill, so loud, so indescribably horrible,"
21752 "that its conception must be left entirely to the reader's imagination."
21752 ""
21752 "At the same instant Dumps scurried into the kitchen.  The scuttle and"
21752 "tongs went down, the slop-pail and shovel followed suit, also the"
21752 "watering-pan, into which latter Dumps went head foremost as it fell, and"
21752 "from its interior another yell issued with such resonant power that the"
21752 "first yell was a mere chirp by contrast.  The Slogger fled from the"
21752 "scene like an evil spirit, while John Waters sprang up and grasped the"
21752 "pistol and poker."
21752 ""
21752 "The effect on Brassey in the drawing-room cannot be conceived, much less"
21752 "described.  He shot, as it were, out of the crimson-gilded chair and"
21752 "overturned the lamp, which burst on the floor.  Being half full of"
21752 "paraffin oil it instantly set fire to the gauze window-curtains.  The"
21752 "burglar made straight for the stairs.  John Waters, observing the light,"
21752 "dashed up the same, and the two met face to face on the landing,"

21752 "My first impulse was to rush to the nearest fire-station; but a wild"

21752 "savage curse, as a bullet came crashing through the door and went close"

21752 "striking.  Out of four cribs and a cradle arose five cones of"
21752 "bed-clothes, with a pretty little curly head surmounting each cone, and"
21752 "ten eyes blazing with amazement.  A tall nurse stood erect in the middle"

21752 "from the windows below.  I could see that the fire was roaring out into"
21752 "the street, and lighting up hundreds of faces below, while the steady"
21752 "clank of engines told that the brigade was busily at work fighting the"
21752 "flames.  But I had no time to look or think.  Indeed, I felt as if I had"

21752 "had lost almost cost us our lives.  I knew that to breathe the dense"

21752 "physic and some one to attend to her.  She suggested, indeed, that the"

21752 "be of no use, and might be too late.  Would she just run round an' see"
21752 "her?  The girl acted on the spur of the moment.  In her exuberant"
21752 "sympathy she hurried down an alley, round a corner, under an archway,"

21752 "her.  Then she tried to shriek, but a powerful hand on her mouth"
21752 "prevented that also.  Then she fainted.  Not wishing to be found in an"

21752 "occasion, Mrs McTougall carefully printed in huge letters, and"
21752 "elaborately illuminated the sentence, \"Be kind to Doggie,\" and hung it"

21752 "of the boy's mind.  The pleasure obviously afforded to him by the"
21752 "uncertainty as to results in experiments was very great.  The"
21752 "probability of a miscarriage created in him intense interest--I will not"
21752 "say hope!  The ignorance of what was coming kept him in a constant"
21752 "flutter of subdued excitement, and the astounding results (even"
21752 "sometimes to myself) of some of my combinations, kept him in a perpetual"
21752 "simmer of expectation.  But after long observation, I have come to the"

21752 "to come and play with them, which he seems quite pleased to do, and then"
21752 "his mind is so eccentric, so inventive.  The new games he devises are"

21752 "proposed the storming of an ogre's castle.  Nurse was down-stairs at the"
21752 "time, or it could never have happened.  Well, of course, Robin was the"
21752 "ogre, darling Dolly was a princess whom he had stolen away, Jack was a"

21752 "chairs in the room piled on each other, with one particular chair so"
21752 "ingeniously arranged that the pulling of it out would bring the castle"
21752 "in ruins to the ground.  The plan of attack, as far as I could make out,"
21752 "was that the prince should ring our dinner-bell at the castle gates and"
21752 "fiercely demand admittance, the demand to be followed by a burst from"
21752 "the trumpets, drums, and gongs of his soldiers.  The ogre, seated on the"
21752 "castle top with the princess, after a few preliminary yells and howls,"
21752 "was to say, in a gruff voice, that he was too much engaged just then"
21752 "with his dinner--that three roast babies were being dished.  When they"
21752 "were disposed of, the princess would be killed, and served up as a sort"
21752 "of light pudding, after which he would open the castle gate.  A horrible"
21752 "smell was to be created at this point to represent the roasting of the"
21752 "babies.  This was to be the signal for a burst of indignation from the"
21752 "prince and his troops, who were to make a furious assault on the door--"
21752 "one of our largest tea-trays--and after a little the prince was to pull"

21752 "falling ruin, while the ogre and princess were to find shelter under the"

21752 "dead among the ruins.  I am not sure whether the princess was to be"
21752 "revived, or she was to have a grand funeral, but the play never got that"
21752 "length.  I was sitting here, listening to the various sounds overhead,"
21752 "wondering what they could be about, when I heard a loud ringing--that"
21752 "was the castle bell.  It was soon followed by a burst of toy trumpets"
21752 "and drums.  A most disgusting smell began to permeate the house at the"
21752 "same time, for it seems that the ogre set fire to his chemicals too"
21752 "soon."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Then I heard roaring and yelling, which really alarmed me--it was so"
21752 "gruff.  When it stopped, there was a woeful howl--that was the burst of"
21752 "indignation.  The assault came off next, and as the shouting of the"
21752 "troops was mingled with the hammering of the large tea-tray, the ringing"
21752 "of the dinner-bell, and the beating of the gong, you may fancy what the"
21752 "noise was.  In the midst of it there was a hideous crash, accompanied by"
21752 "screams of alarm that were too genuine to be mistaken.  I rushed up, and"
21752 "found the furniture lying scattered over the room, with darling Dolly in"
21752 "the midst, the others standing in solemn silence around, and Robin"
21752 "Slidder sitting on the ground ruefully rubbing his head."

21752 "\"The truth was that the particular chair had been pulled away before the"

21752 "the expense of his own head and shoulder, by throwing his arms round her"

21752 "facetious cabby, or make a politely sarcastic remark to a bobby.  His"
21752 "connection with what he termed \"'igh life\" had softened him down"

21752 "that you were the means of introducing me to that angel, Lilly Blythe.\""

21752 "The angel in question went that Sunday evening at seven o'clock, as was"
21752 "her wont, to a Bible class which she had started for the instruction of"
21752 "some of the poor neglected boys and lads who idled about in the dreary"
21752 "back streets of our aristocratic neighbourhood.  The boys had become so"
21752 "fond of her that they were eager to attend, and usually assembled round"
21752 "the door of the class-room before the hour."
21752 ""
21752 "My _protege_, Robin Slidder, was of course one of her warmest adherents."
21752 "He was standing that night apart from the other boys, contemplating the"
21752 "proceedings of two combative sparrows which quarrelled over a crumb of"
21752 "bread on the pavement, and had just come to the conclusion that men and"
21752 "sparrows had some qualities in common, when he was attracted by a low"
21752 "whistle, and, looking up, beheld the Slogger peeping round a"
21752 "neighbouring corner."

21752 "\"Hallo!  Slog--Villum I mean; how are you?  Come along.  Vell, I _am_"
21752 "glad to see you, for, d'you know, arter you failed me that day at the"

21752 "\"Vell, not exactly, but you'll hear wot she teaches for yourself"
21752 "to-night, I 'ope.  Come, I'm right glad to see you, Villum.  What was it"
21752 "that prevented you that day, eh?\""
21752 ""
21752 "When the Slogger had explained and cleared his character, Robin asked"
21752 "him eagerly if he had ascertained anything further about the girl whom"
21752 "he and Brassey had robbed."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Of course I have,\" said the Slogger, \"and it's a curious suckumstance"
21752 "that 'er place of abode--so Sally says--is in the Vest End, not wery far"
21752 "from here.  She gave me the street and the name, but wasn't quite sure"
21752 "of the number.\""

21752 "\"Vell, come along, let's hear all about it,\" said Robin impatiently."

21752 "\"Wy, wot's all your 'urry?\" returned the Slogger slowly; \"I ain't goin'"
21752 "away till I've heerd wot your angel's got to say, you know.  Besides, I"
21752 "must go arter your meeting's over an watch the 'ouse till I see the gal"
21752 "an' make sure that it's her, for Sally may have bin mistook, you know.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"You don't know her name, do you?\" asked Robin; \"it wasn't Edie Willis,"
21752 "now, was it?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"'Ow should _I_ know 'er name?\" answered the Slogger.  \"D'you think I"
21752 "stopped to inquire w'en I 'elped to relieve 'er of 'er propity?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Ah, I suppose not.  Vell, I suppose you've no objection to my goin' to"
21752 "watch along wi' you.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"None wotsomever; on'y remember, if it do turn out to be 'er, you won't"

21752 "'ave me took up if she got 'old of me.\""
21752 ""
21752 "Robin Slidder faithfully and earnestly pledged himself.  While he was"
21752 "speaking there was a general movement among the lads and boys towards"
21752 "the class-room, for Miss Blythe was seen coming towards them.  The two"
21752 "friends moved with the rest.  Just as he was about to enter the door,"
21752 "Robin missed his companion, and, looking back, saw him bending down, and"
21752 "holding his sides as if in pain."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Wot's wrong now?\" he inquired, returning to him."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh!  I'm took so bad,\" said the Slogger, looking very red, and rubbing"
21752 "himself; \"a old complaint as I thought I was cured of.  Oh, dear! you'll"
21752 "'ave to excuge me, Robin.  I'll go an' take a turn, an' come in if I"
21752 "gits better.  If not, I'll meet you round the corner arter it's over.\""

21752 "So saying, the Slogger, turning round, walked quickly away, and his"
21752 "little friend entered the class-room in a state of mind pendulating"
21752 "between disgust and despair, for he had no expectation of seeing the"
21752 "slippery Slogger again that night."
21752 ""
21752 "When the meeting was over, Miss Blythe returned home.  I saw her enter"
21752 "the library.  No one else was there, I knew.  The gas had not yet been"
21752 "lighted, and only a faint flicker from the fire illumined the room."
21752 "Unable to bear the state of uncertainty under which my mind still"
21752 "laboured, I resolved to make assurance doubly sure, or quit the house--"
21752 "and England--for ever!"

21752 "For the second time that day Dr McTougall interrupted me, but I was"
21752 "proof against annoyance now."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Yes, I am here,\" I shouted, running downstairs.  \"Surely Dumps is not"
21752 "burning himself again--eh?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh no,\" returned my friend, with a laugh--\"only a telegram.  However,"
21752 "it's important enough to require prompt attention.  The Gordons in"
21752 "Bingley Manor--you know them--telegraph me to run down immediately; old"
21752 "lady ill.  Now, it unfortunately happens that I have an engagement this"
21752 "evening which positively cannot be put off, so I must send you."
21752 "Besides, I know well enough what it is.  They're easily alarmed, and I'm"
21752 "convinced it is just the old story.  However, the summons must be"
21752 "obeyed.  You will go for me.  The train starts in half an hour.  You"
21752 "will have plenty of time to catch it, if you make haste.  You'll have to"
21752 "stay all night.  No return train till to-morrow, being an out-of-the-way"

21752 ""
21752 "So saying, the doctor put on his hat and left the house."
21752 ""
21752 "Summoning Robin Slidder, I bade him pack a few things into my"
21752 "travelling-bag while I wrote a note.  When he had finished he told me of"
21752 "his interview with the Slogger.  I was greatly interested, and asked if"
21752 "he had gone to see his friend after the meeting."
21752 ""
21752 "\"No, sir, I didn't.  I meant to, but Miss Blythe wanted me to walk 'ome"

21752 "\"Pity, Robin--a great pity,\" said I, hastily strapping up my bag, \"but"
21752 "no doubt he'll come here again to see you.--Now, don't forget to take"

21752 "The new residence of the old woman being now so near to Hoboy Crescent"

21752 "it, also at the preparing and consuming of some of its contents.  Of"
21752 "course he chatted vigorously, as was his wont, but was particularly"
21752 "careful to make not the most distant allusion to the Slogger or his"
21752 "reports, being anxious not to arouse her hopes until he should have some"
21752 "evidence that they were on a true scent.  Indeed, he was so fearful of"
21752 "letting slip some word or remark on the subject and thereby awakening"
21752 "suspicion and giving needless pain, that he abstained from all reference"
21752 "to the meeting of that evening, and launched out instead into wonderful"
21752 "and puzzling theological speculations, of which he was very fond."
21752 ""
21752 "Meanwhile I was carried swiftly into the country.  The lamp in my"
21752 "carriage was too dim to permit of reading; I therefore wrapped myself in"
21752 "my rug and indulged in pleasant meditations."
21752 ""
21752 "It was past midnight when I arrived at the station for Bingley Manor,"
21752 "where I found a gig awaiting me.  A sharp drive of half an hour and I"
21752 "was at the mansion door."
21752 ""
21752 "Dr McTougall was right.  There was little the matter with old Mrs"
21752 "Gordon, but the family were nervous, and rich--hence my visit.  I did"
21752 "what was necessary for the patient, comforted the rest by my presence,"
21752 "had a sound night's rest, an early breakfast, a pleasant drive in the"
21752 "fresh frosty air, and a brief wait of five minutes, when the punctual"
21752 "train came up."
21752 ""
21752 "There is something inexpressibly delightful in a ride, on a sharp frosty"
21752 "morning, in an express train.  I have always felt a wild bounding"
21752 "sensation of joy in rapid motion.  The pace at which we went that"
21752 "morning was exceptionally charming.  Had I known that the engine-driver"
21752 "was intoxicated perhaps it might not have been quite so exhilarating,"
21752 "but I did not know that.  I sat comfortably in my corner thinking of"
21752 "Edith, and gazing with placid benignity at the frosted trees and bushes"
21752 "which sparkled in the red wintry sun."
21752 ""
21752 "Yes, it was a glorious ride!  I never had a better.  The part of the"
21752 "country through which we passed was lovely.  One can always gaze"
21752 "comfortably at the _distant_ landscape from a railway carriage, however"
21752 "great the speed.  As for the immediate foreground, it reminded me of a"
21752 "race--houses, trees, farms, towns, villages, hamlets, horses, sheep,"
21752 "cattle, poultry, hayricks, brickfields, were among the competitors in"
21752 "that race.  They rushed in mad confusion to the rear.  I exulted in the"
21752 "pace.  Not so a stout elderly gentleman in the opposite corner, who"
21752 "evidently disliked it--so true is it that \"one man's meat is another's"
21752 "poison.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"There is no reason to fear, sir,\" said I, with a smile, by way of"

21752 "\"Too fast just now, anyhow,\" returned the elderly gentleman testily."

21752 "\"That is a sign of safety,\" said I; \"shows that they are on the alert.\""

21752 "A severe application of the brakes caused me to stop abruptly, and the"
21752 "elderly man to seize the arms of his seat with a convulsive grasp."
21752 ""
21752 "Suddenly there was a mighty crash.  The sensations in my mind that"
21752 "followed were suggestive of cannons, rockets, bombs, fireworks,"

21752 "state of wild horror, and was attempting to rush across a crowded"
21752 "thoroughfare, when a cab knocked me down.  I felt a sharp pang of pain,"
21752 "heard a loud shout and then all was dark."
21752 ""
21752 "\"On recovering I found myself lying in one of the beds of a hospital."
21752 "My collar-bone had been broken, and I was very feverish--scarcely"
21752 "understood where I was, and felt a dull sense of oppression on my brain."
21752 "They spoke to me, and asked my name.  I don't remember distinctly how I"
21752 "pronounced it, but I recollect being somewhat amused at their"
21752 "misunderstanding what I said, and calling me Miss Eva Bright!  I felt"
21752 "too ill to correct them at the time, and afterwards became so accustomed"
21752 "to Eva--for I was a very long time there--that I did not think it worth"
21752 "while to correct the mistake.  This was very foolish and unfortunate,"
21752 "for long afterwards, when I began to get well enough to think"
21752 "coherently, and sent them to let granny know where I was, they of course"
21752 "went with the name of Eva Bright.  It was very stupid, no doubt, but I"
21752 "was so weak and listless after my long and severe illness that this"
21752 "never once occurred to me.  As it turned out, however, there would have"
21752 "been no difference in the result, for my darling had left her lodging"
21752 "and gone no one knew where.  This terrible news brought on a relapse,"
21752 "and for many weeks, I believe, my life hung on a thread.  But that"
21752 "thread was in the hand of God, and I had no fear.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"What is the name, Edie, of the grandmother you have lost?\"  I asked, in"
21752 "a low, tremulous voice."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Willis--but--why do you start so?  Now I am quite _sure_ you have been"
21752 "more severely hurt than you imagine, and that my talking so much is not"
21752 "good for you.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"No--Edie--no.  Go on,\" I said firmly."
21752 ""
21752 "\"I have little more to tell,\" she continued.  \"Dear Dr McTougall had"
21752 "attended me in the hospital, and took a fancy to me.  When I was well"
21752 "enough to leave, he took me home to be governess to his children.  But"
21752 "my situation has been an absolute sinecure as yet, for he says I am not"
21752 "strong enough to work, and won't let me do anything.  It was not till"
21752 "after I had left the hospital that I told my kind friend the mistake"
21752 "that had been made about my name, and about my lost grandmother.  He has"
21752 "been very kind about that, and assisted me greatly at first in my search"
21752 "for her.  But there are so many--so many people of the name of Willis in"
21752 "London--old ladies too!  We called together on so many that he got tired"
21752 "of it at last.  Of course I wrote to various people at York, and to the"
21752 "place where we had lived before going there, but nothing came of it, and"
21752 "now--my hopes have long ago died out--that is to say, almost--but I"
21752 "still continue to make inquiries.\""
21752 ""
21752 "She paused here for some time, and I did not move or speak, being so"
21752 "stunned by my discovery that I knew not what to say, and feared to"
21752 "reveal the truth to Edith too suddenly.  Then I knew by the gentle way"
21752 "in which she moved that she thought I had fallen asleep.  I was glad of"
21752 "this, and remained quietly thinking."
21752 ""
21752 "There was no doubt now in my mind that Edie Blythe was this lost"
21752 "granddaughter of old Mrs Willis, but the name still remained an"
21752 "insoluble mystery."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Edie,\" said I abruptly, \"_is_ your name Blythe?\""

21752 "\"Of course it is,\" she said, in startled surprise, \"why should you doubt"
21752 "it?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"I _don't_ doubt it,\" said I, \"but I'm sorely puzzled.  Why is it not"
21752 "Willis?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Why?\" exclaimed Edie, with a little laugh, \"because I am the daughter"
21752 "of Granny Willis's daughter--not of her son.  My father's name was"
21752 "Blythe!\""
21752 ""
21752 "The simplicity of this explanation, and my gross stupidity in quietly"
21752 "assuming from the beginning, as a matter of course, that the lost Edie's"
21752 "name was the same as her grandmother's, burst upon me in its full force."
21752 "The delusion had been naturally perpetuated by Mrs Willis never"
21752 "speaking of her lost darling except by her Christian name.  For a few"
21752 "seconds I was silent, then I exploded in almost an hysterical fit of"
21752 "laughter, in the midst of which I was interrupted by the sudden entrance"
21752 "of my doggie, who had returned from a walk with Robin, and began to"
21752 "gambol round his mistress as if he had not seen her for years."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh, sir!  I say!  I've diskivered all about--\""

21752 "Little Slidder had rushed excitedly into the room, but stopped abruptly"
21752 "on observing Miss Blythe, who was looking from him to me with intense"
21752 "surprise."

21752 "Before another word could be said, a servant entered:--"

21752 "The excited boy obeyed, and Dumps, leaping on another chair beside him,"
21752 "sat down to listen, with ears erect, as if he knew what was coming."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh, sir! you never--such a go!\" began Robin, rubbing his hands together"
21752 "slowly as he spoke.  \"The Slogger! he twigged 'er at once.  You'll open"
21752 "your eyes so wide that you'll never git 'em shut again, w'en you hears."
21752 "No, I never _did_ see such a lark!  Edie's found!  I've seen her!  She"
21752 "ain't the Queen--oh no; nor yet one o' the Queen's darters--by no means;"
21752 "nor yet a duchess--oh dear no, though she's like one.  Who d'ye think"
21752 "she is?  But you'll never guess.\""

21752 "\"Why--how--ever--did you come to guess it?\" gasped the boy, on"
21752 "recovering himself."
21752 ""
21752 "\"I did not guess it, I found it out.  Do you suppose that nobody can"
21752 "find out things except Sloggers and pages in buttons?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh, sir, _do_ tell!\" entreated the boy."
21752 ""
21752 "I did tell, and after we had each told all that we knew, we mentally"
21752 "hugged ourselves, and grew so facetious over it that we began to address"
21752 "Dumps personally, to that intelligent creature's intense satisfaction."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Now, Robin,\" said I, \"we must break this _very_ cautiously to the old"
21752 "lady and Miss Blythe.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh, in course--we-r-y cautiously,\" assented the urchin, with"
21752 "inconceivable earnestness."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Well, then, off you go and fetch my greatcoat.  We'll go visit Mrs"
21752 "Willis at once.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"At vunce,\" echoed Robin, as he ran out of the room, with blazing cheeks"
21752 "and sparkling eyes."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Lilly,\" said Dr McTougall, as Edith entered his consulting-room.  \"I'm"
21752 "just off to see a patient who is very ill, and there is another who is"
21752 "not quite so ill, but who also wants to see me.  I'll send you to the"
21752 "latter as my female assistant, if you will go.  Her complaint is chiefly"
21752 "mental.  In fact, she needs comfort more than physic, and I know of no"
21752 "one who is comparable to you in that line.  Can you go?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Certainly, with pleasure.  I'll go at once.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Her name,\" said the doctor, \"is Willis.--By the way, that reminds me of"
21752 "your loss, dear girl,\" he continued in a lower tone, as he gently took"
21752 "her hand, \"but I would not again arouse your hopes.  You know how many"
21752 "old women of this name we have seen without finding her.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Yes, I know too well,\" returned poor Edith, while the tears gathered in"
21752 "her eyes.  \"I have long ago given up all hope.\""
21752 ""
21752 "But notwithstanding her statement Edith had not quite given way to"
21752 "despair.  In spite of herself her heart fluttered a little as she sped"

21752 "When Robin and I reached the abode of our old friend--in a state, let me"
21752 "add, of almost irrepressible excitement--we found her seated in the old"
21752 "arm-chair by the window, gazing sadly out on the prospect."
21752 ""
21752 "It was not now the prospect of red brick and water-spout, with a remote"
21752 "distance of chimney--cans and cats, which had crushed the old lady's"
21752 "spirit in other days--by no means.  There was a picturesque little"
21752 "court, with an old pump in the centre to awaken the fancy, and frequent"
21752 "visits from more or less diabolical street-boys, to excite the"
21752 "imagination.  Beyond that there was the mews, in which a lively scene of"
21752 "variance between horses and men was enacted from morning till night--a"
21752 "scene which derived much additional charm from the fact that Mrs"
21752 "Willis, being short-sighted, formed fearfully incorrect estimates of"
21752 "men, and beasts, and things in general."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Well, granny, how are you?\" said I, seating myself on a stool beside"
21752 "her, and thinking how I should begin."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Pretty griggy--eh?\" inquired little Slidder."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Ah! there you are, my dear boys,\" said the old lady, who had latterly"
21752 "got to look upon me and my _protege_ as brothers.  \"You are always sure"
21752 "to come, whoever fails me.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Has any one failed you to-day, granny?\"  I asked."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Yes, Dr McTougall has,\" she replied as petulantly as it was possible"
21752 "for her to speak.  \"I've been feeling very low and weak to-day, and sent"
21752 "for him; but I suppose he thinks it's only imagination.  Well, well,"
21752 "perhaps it is,\" she added, after a pause, and with a little sigh.  \"I'm"
21752 "very foolish, no doubt.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"No, granny,\" said I, \"you're not foolish,\"--(\"Contrariwise, wery much"
21752 "the reverse,\" interrupted Slidder)--\"and I'm glad that I chanced to come"
21752 "in, because, perhaps, I may be able to prescribe for you as well as he.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Better, dear boy, better\"--(\"That's it, cheer up!\" from Slidder)--\"and"
21752 "it always does me a world of good to see your handsome face.\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Well, granny,\" said I, with a flutter at my heart, as I looked up at"
21752 "her thin careworn face, and began to break the ice with caution, \"I've"
21752 "come--I--there's a little piece of--of--\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Now then, dig in the spurs, doctor, an' go at it--neck or nuffin',\""

21752 ""
21752 "\"What are you saying, Robin?\" asked Mrs Willis, with a slightly anxious"
21752 "look.  \"There's nothing wrong, I hope?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"No, no; nothing wrong, granny,\" said I, hastening to the point; \"very"
21752 "much the reverse.  But--but--you heard of my accident, of course?\"  I"
21752 "said, suddenly losing heart and beating about the bush."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Stuck again!\" murmured Slidder, in a tone of disgust."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Yes, yes; I heard of it.  You don't mean to say that you're getting"
21752 "worse?\" said the old lady, with increasing anxiety."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh no!  I'm better--much better.  Indeed, I don't think I ever felt so"
21752 "well in my life; and I've just heard a piece of good news, which, I'm"
21752 "quite sure, will make you very glad--very glad indeed!\""

21752 "\"Go it, sir!  Another burst like that and you'll be clear out o' the"

21752 "\"Whew! you never told _me_ that!\" exclaimed Slidder, with widening eyes."
21752 ""
21752 "\"_Will_ you be quiet, Robin?\" said I, rather sternly; \"how can I get"
21752 "over this very difficult matter if you go on interrupting me so?\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Mum's the word!\" returned the boy, folding his hands, and assuming a"
21752 "look of ridiculous solemnity."
21752 ""
21752 "At that moment we heard a noise of pattering feet on the landing"
21752 "outside.  The door, which had not been properly closed, burst open, and"
21752 "my doggie came into the room all of a heap.  After a brief moment lost"
21752 "in apparently searching for his hind-legs, he began to dance and frisk"
21752 "about the room as if all his limbs were whalebone and his spirit"
21752 "quicksilver."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Oh, there's that dog again!  Put it out! put it out!\" cried Mrs"

21752 ""
21752 "There was a feeble cry at the window.  I observed that the sweet smile"
21752 "vanished, and a deadly pallor overspread Edith's face, while her eyes"
21752 "gazed with eager surprise at the old lady for a few seconds.  Mrs"
21752 "Willis sat with answering gaze and outstretched arms."
21752 ""
21752 "\"Edie!\""
21752 ""
21752 "\"Granny!\" was all that either could gasp, but there was no need for"
21752 "more--the lost ones were mutually found!  With an indescribable cry of"
21752 "joy Edith sprang forward, fell on her knees, and enfolded granny in her"
21752 "arms."
21752 ""
21752 "\"'Ere you are, doctor,\" whispered Robin, touching me on the elbow and"
21752 "presenting a tumbler of water."

21752 "\"She'll need it, doctor.  I knows her well, an' it's the on'y thing as"
21752 "does her good w'en she's took bad.\""
21752 ""
21752 "Slidder was right.  The shock of joy was almost too much for the old"
21752 "lady.  She leaned heavily on her granddaughter's neck, and if I had not"
21752 "caught her, both must have fallen to the ground.  We lifted her gently"
21752 "into bed, and in a few minutes she recovered."
21752 ""
21752 "For some time she lay perfectly still.  Edith, reclining on the lowly"

21752 "your roof.\""

21752 "\"Ah! to be sure,\" returned the doctor, falling in with my humour, \"we"

21752 "the street in fine weather, or flatten our noses on the glass, and make"
21752 "faces at each other when the weather is bad.  Besides, we can have a"
21752 "tunnel cut under the street and thus have subterranean communication at"

21752 "From that date forward, for many weeks, the number of lost grandmothers"
21752 "that were found in the McTougall nursery surpasses belief.  They were"
21752 "discovered in all sorts of places, and in all imaginable circumstances--"
21752 "under beds, tables, upturned baths, and basin-stands; in closets,"
21752 "trunks, and cupboards, and always in a condition of woeful weakness and"
21752 "melancholy destitution.  The part of grandmother was invariably assigned"
21752 "to Dolly, because, although the youngest of the group, that little"
21752 "creature possessed a power of acting and of self-control which none of"
21752 "the others could equal.  At first they were careful to keep as close to"
21752 "the original event as possible; but after a time, thirsting for variety,"
21752 "they became lax, and the grandmothers were found not only by"
21752 "granddaughters, but by daughters, and cousins, and nieces, and nephews;"
